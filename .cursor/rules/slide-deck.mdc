# Slide deck from Markdown

When the user asks to generate slides (e.g. "generate slides", "build slide deck", "update slides") from a Markdown presentation:

1. Treat each `## Slide X — ...` as a separate slide; top-level `# ...` as the title slide.
2. Preserve bullets, bold, and formatting. Preserve all `mermaid` blocks exactly (do not rewrite).
3. For each slide: title from heading, body from content. Do not invent slides.
4. **Output:** Markdown, slides separated by `---`, Mermaid blocks inside their slide.

If the user requests speaker notes: add a **Speaker Notes** section under each slide (3–6 sentences), without changing slide content.

Goal: presentation-ready deck for tools that support Markdown and Mermaid.
