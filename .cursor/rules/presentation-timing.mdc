# Presentation timing

The **entire presentation** must run in **under 40 minutes**.

## Constraints

- Total speaking time for all slides: **&lt; 40 minutes**.
- When adding or expanding slides, preserve this limit: trim elsewhere or keep new content short.
- Respect existing `<!-- Pacing: X minutes -->` comments per slide; they should sum to under 40.

## When editing the presentation

- Prefer concise slides; avoid long bullet lists or redundant points.
- If total estimated time exceeds 40 minutes, suggest cuts or merges (e.g. combine slides, shorten examples).
- When asked to add content, remind that the 40-minute cap applies and offer to trim another section if needed.
