# Speaker notes for slides

When the user asks to add speaker notes (e.g. "add speaker notes", "generate speaker notes", "annotate slides"):

1. **Do not modify slide content.** Keep headings, bullets, and Mermaid diagrams as written.
2. **For each slide**, append a **"Speaker Notes"** section directly beneath the slide content.
3. Notes must: be conversational (30–40 min presentation), 3–6 sentences per slide, explain _why_ the slide matters, highlight trade-offs and narrative flow. For slides with Mermaid, explain the diagram and structure.
4. **Format:** Markdown, slides separated by `---`, Speaker Notes after each slide body and before the next `---`.
5. "Concise notes" → 1–2 sentences; "extended notes" → 6–10 sentences.

Goal: presentation-ready notes for a confident, senior-level technical narrative.
